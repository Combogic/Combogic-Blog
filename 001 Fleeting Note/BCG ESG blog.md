- Simultaneously, the growth of [socially responsible investing](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/climate-change-sustainability/sustainable-investing) (SRI) is accelerating; SRI assets now represent more than 36% of global assets under management, and they are projected to total $53 trillion by 2025.
- There is a growing vanguard of voices, including that of [BlackRock CEO Larry Fink](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/interview-with-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink), insisting that purpose and ESG leadership are key to long-term performance.
- And top performers on ESG topics are rewarded with valuation multiples that are [3% to 19% higher](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/total-societal-impact-new-lens-strategy) than those of median performers on those topics
- Top performers on ESG topics are also better able to attract and retain talent; according to a report by Marsh and McLennan, the companies that are most appealing to students and young professionals scored 25% higher than their peers on ESG metrics.
- **領導公司不把ESG當成一種社會責任標籤、一種公關手法，而是公司治理上，從本質轉變的方法論，是提升整體公司體質、建造強大競爭力的手段。 leading companies shift and treat them as a competitive advantage and, ultimately, a calling. (See the exhibit.)**

# Eco-Driving and Its Impacts on Fuel Efficiency: An Overview of Technologies and Data-Driven Methods
Created: 2022-10-07 16:02

Recent research has revealed that **eco-driving is capable of reducing fuel consumption by an amount ranging from 15% to 25% and GHG emissions by at least 30%** [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B8-sustainability-13-00226), [10]( https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B10-sustainability-13-00226), [15](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B15-sustainability-13-00226),[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B16-sustainability-13-00226). In contrast, the total fuel savings achieved by engines and vehicles of the latest technology is estimated at about 10–12%, which is significantly lower [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B8-sustainability-13-00226)]. According to other researchers, an overall ecological behavior, including the purchase of the vehicle, as well as its usage, and ecological decision-making concerning mobility, are considered to lead to fuel consumption reduction of the order of 40–45% [17](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/226/htm#B17-sustainability-13-00226)].

- ## Fuel Consumption and Climate Protection

ECO-DRIVING trainings lead to consumption reduction up to 20% directly after training and about 5% in the long run. The European Climate Change Programme calculated a reduction potential of ECO-DRIVING of at least 50 million tons of CO2-emissions in Europe by 2010, saving about 20 billion EUROS.

Eleven month after ECO-DRIVING trainings, the German company HAMBURGER WASSERWERKE effected fuel consumption reductions of more than 6%, accidents and related costs could be deminished by more than 25%.

ECO-DRIVING programmes prove to be very cost-effective. The Dutch ECO-DRIVING programme results in a cost-effectiveness of about 5 EURO per avoided ton of CO2-emissions over a period of 10 years.

CANON COMPANY in Switzerland trained the ECO-DRIVING style with 350 service car drivers in VSZ VELTHEIM. The drivers reduced fuel consumption by 6.1%, had 22% more km per accident and 35% less accidents in total.

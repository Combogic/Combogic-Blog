# 瑞典SIGMA黑客松專案：使用SAS Viya作路徑分析，找出最低碳排的路徑
Created: 2022-10-08 15:49

- 專案發起是SIGMA的SAS® Nordic Hackathon黑客松團隊，需求客戶是EI-Kresten（瑞典電子廢棄物回收業者），動機是他們想要找到最有效的低碳排路徑，減少碳足跡。
- 他們自己在運輸電子廢棄物過程中，每年產生約3500噸碳排。
-  The solution was designed to build smart routes of e-waste transportation using real-time data about the readiness of collection points and predict route efficiency, as well as their impact on CO2 emissions.
- The technologies used for developing the route planning tool:
	1.  SAS® Viya
	2.  SAS® Visual Analytics
	3.  Microsoft Azure
	4.  Python open source
- By using the SAS® Viya solution, we have created two dashboards: a map itself and the progress report. The map indicated the current performance and predictions to enable smarter decisions. The progress report with simple charts and graphs shows how the route optimization algorithm helps decrease CO2 emissions.
- **Once this algorithm is integrated into the logistic chain, it is forecasted to mitigate 836 tonnes of CO2 emissions and save up to 329.000 liters of fuel a year.**

- Eco-driving results in an average 7.5% fuel-saving.  So, an effective 14c per litre reduction would mean an annual **saving of €300** for every 2,200 litres.
- Similarly, research also shows reductions in Servicing, Maintenance and Repair costs of up to 20% per vehicle - plus reduced depreciation - realises about **€250 per vehicle, each year**. Sustainable driving also improves your insurance rating on renewal which could be worth **€100 per vehicle**, per year.
- So, if 25% of your vehicles are involved in an incident per annum (with an average claim of €1,500), then assuming a net margin on turnover of 15%, your business needs to generate an extra €10,000 in sales **for every single vehicle** in your fleet - not just those in collisions - simply to break-even.
	Avoiding just 25% of crashes is likely to **save you €350 or more per vehicle, each year**.

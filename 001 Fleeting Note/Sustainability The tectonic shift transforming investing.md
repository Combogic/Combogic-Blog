# Sustainability The tectonic shift transforming investing
Created: 2022-10-14 13:27

- A commonly held view is that a return sacrifice is necessary when adopting sustainable investing because the shift is already embedded in current market prices. We disagree.
- The fundamental point often overlooked is the concept of a long transition between now and a future state, driven by investment flows, as sustainability effects become embedded in market pricing. Because these flows are in their early stages, we believe that the full consequences of a shift to sustainable investing are not yet in market prices. Assets backed by high sustainability will become more expensive while others will become cheaper during the transition period, in our view, meaning that those holding sustainable assets will earn a return benefit during this transition.

基本上來說，這份報告認為 永續、ESG投資（或者企業體轉型）可以並不是賠錢，而是一份長期的投資，在未來世代更重視永續概念情況下會有所回報。

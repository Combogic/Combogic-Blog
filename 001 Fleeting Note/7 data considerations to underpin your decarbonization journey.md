Emissions reduction strategies require two essential ingredients: a verifiable and robust data foundation and a financial-grade greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting process.

So how can organizations prepare their data to accelerate their emission reduction goals? This article outlines tried and tested guidelines for establishing a financial-grade, best practice sustainability data foundation.

### 1. Create a robust and flexible data structure
Tips: 

-   Review the detailed reporting requirements of pledges or commitments you have made, and ensure your team understands what data it needs to support them.
-   Regularly check and maintain metadata (tags, labels, opening/closing dates, etc.)
-   Set minimum key performance indicators for the data management process to define thresholds such as "data completeness," and document the decisions.
### 2. Review data accessibility and evaluate options for data capture

-   Consider outsourcing the data capture process to a specialist service provider.
-   Get as close to the original data source as you can.
-   Aim for automated data transfer wherever possible. Minimize human intervention: Files touched by people prior to data collection are more prone to failure to load, precision loss and metric confusion.
-   Consider how you will store and manage the data on an ongoing basis. A cloud-based enterprise software platform is infinitely superior to spreadsheets for this task.
### 3. Work with your utility providers
-   Contact your utility provider and explore data sharing options. The preference should be an automated data provision via either an online portal or via an application programming interface that allows data exchange.
-   Consider working with a specialist partner to automate the data capture process.
-   Include a data provision clause in all new energy procurement contracts.

### 4. Develop processes for data management and assign ownership
-   Create an accountability matrix for data management and assign responsibilities to staff. This matrix should set out a regular schedule to review data completeness to catch errors in time to address them.
-   Keep a close eye on data flowing in. Set up inactivity alerts against each data source to identify data gaps early on.
-   Institute a process to reconfigure formatting updates from utility supplier updates. A small change such as which column a data is located on within a bill can prevent your data from loading properly.
-   Follow up promptly with parties that have not fulfilled data provision commitments.

### 5. Create a single, trusted source to store and share your data

Tips: 

-   Use cloud-based storage to provide password-protected access for all stakeholders
-   Ensure supplier contracts are worded to ensure data ownership rests with your organization.
### 6. Align your data capture and management plan with audit requirements
-   Consult with your auditor up front, understand their requirements and ensure your policies for data retention and tagging are aligned.
-   Leverage a cloud-based single system of record that includes change tracking and document storage, and that can easily be configured to provide access to external parties as required.

### 7. Engage your teams early in the process

-   Elevate the importance of GHG data capture and storage within the organization to senior level management to encourage participation and support.
-   Consider internal reporting tools to provide transparency and drive accountability for data capture and storage.

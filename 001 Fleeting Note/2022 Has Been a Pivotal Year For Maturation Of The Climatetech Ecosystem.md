Investment into climatetech has skyrocketed in the last decade, going from little known fringe investment vertical to the fastest growing investment vertical. And since 2010, the number of climatetech companies has grown by 4x to reach over 44,500 in 2022.

The US boasts the highest number of climatetech startups and scaleups with 14,300, [according to technation](https://technation.io/climate-tech-report-2022/#key-statistics "https://technation.io/climate-tech-report-2022/#key-statistics"). The UK comes next in line with over 5,200 climatetech startups.

In 2021, 15% of all investment went to climatetech and the ecosystem matured by leaps and bounds, with bigger ticket investment deals of over $250 million up by 5x compared to 2017.

Investment in climatetech in Germany has shot through the roof with an incredible 344% increase in investment in just one year – from 2020-2021. Overall, France and Germany have been significant growth hotspots for climatetech, with Germany taking over Sweden, [technation reports](https://technation.io/climate-tech-report-2022/#key-statistics "https://technation.io/climate-tech-report-2022/#key-statistics").



Climatetech benefits from patient, slow capital; it’s a far cry from the Silicon Valley gold rush. And reliance on government policy can also carry challenges, a sudden change in government policy or direction could be a make or break scenario for some climatetech sectors.


The clean energy sector has become a bright spot with significant growth and investment. [Renewable energy expert, Anthony Agnew](https://thegreentechpreneur.substack.com/p/how-to-fund-and-launch-your-renewable#details "https://thegreentechpreneur.substack.com/p/how-to-fund-and-launch-your-renewable#details"), says he’s seen pivotal progress this year; from new government policies to an acceleration of investment, technology and projects.


“So whilst the initial invasion of Ukraine certainly caused a bit of a pause on things, two months later, people realised that actually, it's going to drive up those power prices and certainly for the medium to short term, those power prices are going to stay high – that's the expectation for the next couple of years.

“Renewable energy and power generation is countercyclical, so it doesn't go up and down as stocks do; we always need energy and energy demand is typically going up anyway. There's now a greater demand and a greater return on investment in renewable energy power projects.”

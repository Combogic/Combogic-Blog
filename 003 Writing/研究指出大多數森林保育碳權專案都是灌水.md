The most important area for reducing over-crediting is changing the way baselines are determined. All protocols, except for CAR-Mexico, offer substantial flexibility in setting project baselines. When there is flexibility, project developers have a financial incentive to choose the option that generates the most credits. ARB and CAR-U.S. allow the developer discretion to use any modeled baseline that is financially, legally, and contractually feasible, and not below the minimum allowed baseline, which is defined as the regional average for most projects. With that discretion, most developers choose baselines at or very close to minimum allowed levels ([Badgley et al., 2022b](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.958879/full#B16)).

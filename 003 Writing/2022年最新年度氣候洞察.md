### 1. The potential to adapt to climate change is not limitless

Rising sea levels are capable of submerging coastal communities and extreme heat is intolerable for human bodies. These are just some examples of ‘hard’ limits that we cannot adapt to.

“1.5C is not a goal, it's a physical limit. Go beyond it and we’re likely to trigger [**tipping points**](https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/16/earth-on-the-brink-of-passing-climate-tipping-points-if-global-warming-continues-at-curren), ” Johan Rockstrom from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research explained at COP27.

“Now we have more and more scientific evidence that it also poses limits to adaptation.”

Going beyond 1.5C would push particularly vulnerable communities past what they can cope with, he added. Reaching 2C would mean that adaptation could by no means substitute climate mitigation.


### 2. Vulnerability hotspots are clustered in ‘regions at risk’

More than three million people will live in ‘vulnerability hotspots’ - areas with the biggest risk of being affected by climate-driven hazards - by 2050. That is double what it is today.

Linking it back to the first insight, Rockstrom said that it would put one-third of the world’s population in areas that are approaching the limits of adaptation.

These areas include low lying coastal regions, tropical forests, regions vulnerable to monsoons and glacier and mountain ecosystems.

### 3. Climate change is adversely affecting the health of humans

# Revealed: more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by biggest certifier are worthless, analysis shows


The investigation found that:

- Only a handful of Verra’s rainforest projects showed evidence of deforestation reductions, according to two studies, with further analysis indicating that 94% of the credits had no benefit to the climate.
    
- The threat to forests had been overstated by about 400% on average for Verra projects, according to analysis of a 2022 University of Cambridge study.
    
- Gucci, Salesforce, BHP, [Shell](https://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell), easyJet, Leon and the band Pearl Jam were among dozens of companies and organisations that have bought rainforest offsets approved by Verra for environmental claims.



The nine-month investigation has been undertaken by the Guardian, the German weekly [Die Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/2023/04/co2-zertifikate-betrug-emissionshandel-klimaschutz?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and [SourceMaterial](https://www.source-material.org/vercompanies-carbon-offsetting-claims-inflated-methodologies-flawed/), a non-profit investigative journalism organisation. It is based on new analysis of scientific studies of Verra’s rainforest schemes.

Human rights issues are a serious concern in at least one of the offsetting projects. The Guardian visited a flagship project in Peru, and was shown videos that residents said showed their homes being cut down with chainsaws and ropes by park guards and police. They spoke of forced evictions and tensions with park authorities.

Separately, the [study by the University of Cambridge team](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13970) of 40 Verra projects found that while a number had stopped some deforestation, the areas were extremely small. Just four projects were responsible for three-quarters of the total forest that was protected.

The journalists again analysed these results more closely and found that, in 32 projects where it was possible to compare Verra’s claims with the study finding, baseline scenarios of forest loss appeared to be overstated by about 400%. Three projects in Madagascar have achieved excellent results and have a significant impact on the figures. If those projects are not included, the average inflation is about 950%.

“I have worked as an auditor on these projects in the Brazilian Amazon and when I started this analysis, I wanted to know if we could trust their predictions about deforestation. The evidence from the analysis – not just the synthetic controls – suggests we cannot. I want this system to work to protect rainforests. For that to happen, we need to acknowledge the scale of problems with the current system,” said Thales West, a lead author on the studies by the international group.


Erin Sills, a co-author in the international group and a professor at North Carolina State University, said the findings were “disappointing and scary”. She was one of several researchers who said urgent changes were needed to finance rainforest conservation.

“It’s really not rocket science,” she said. “We are at an absolutely critical place for the future of tropical forests. If we don’t learn from the failures of the last decade or so, then there’s a very large risk that investors, private individuals and others will move away from any kind of willingness to pay to avoid tropical deforestation and that would be a disaster.




## 為何碳權品質重要？

Ensuring the quality of carbon offsets is crucial for several reasons:  
1. Credibility and Trust: High-quality carbon offsets are verified and certified according to rigorous standards. By ensuring the quality of offsets, we can build trust and credibility in the market. This is important for buyers and investors who want assurance that their carbon offset purchase is making a real and meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
  
2. Additionality and Permanence: Quality offsets must demonstrate additionality, meaning that the emissions reductions or removals would not have occurred without the carbon project. Additionally, quality offsets address concerns about permanence, ensuring that the carbon reductions or removals are long-lasting and do not result in future emissions.  
  
3. Environmental Integrity: Low-quality offsets may not achieve their intended climate mitigation goals. Ensuring quality means measuring and verifying emissions reductions accurately, and taking into account factors such as leakage, buffer accounts, and other potential risks to the integrity of the offset project.  
  
4. Sustainable Development: Quality carbon offsets should contribute to sustainable development objectives, such as supporting local communities, preserving biodiversity, or promoting social and economic co-benefits. Ensuring quality ensures that offset projects have a positive impact beyond just reducing emissions.  
  
By striving for high-quality carbon offsets, we can ensure that the projects we support effectively contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change. It goes beyond just focusing on the quantity of emissions reduced and considers the holistic impact and integrity of the offsets.

# 碳抵銷是不是企業騙局？

YES:
the UK Climate Change Committee published their _Voluntary Carbon Markets and Offsetting_ report, the result of a public call for evidence (read Sylvera’s response [here](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/policy-consultation-response-uk-climate-change-committee-carbon-offsets)). At 102 pages, it’s not light reading, but it’s an important indication of future policy interventions in the UK.

“Right now, the planet cannot afford delays, excuses, or more greenwashing,” says former Canadian climate minister Catherine McKenna in a new report released at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt this month.

_United Nations’ High‐Level Expert Group on the Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities_ (or “Expert Group”).  Its recommendations for making effective climate pledges include a discussion about the role of carbon credits in net zero targets (Recommendation #3).

The report is clear that although carbon credits can help to support accelerated emissions reductions globally, we need better systems in place to “define and ensure standards for both the integrity of the credits themselves and how non-state actors claim them.”

Without these systems and guidelines in place, the voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) is abundant with low-quality carbon credits that could in fact harm progress to reduce emissions in the near term.

But as talks in Sharm el-Sheikh entered their final scheduled day, the latest [draft text](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4_CMA_decision_0.pdf) allowed for double claiming under the Paris Agreement. That means a company can buy credit for an emission reduction that is also being counted by a country towards its climate goals. It would support US climate envoy [John Kerry’s push](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/11/09/john-kerrys-offsets-plan-sets-early-test-for-un-net-zero-standards/) for corporations to plug gaps in climate finance.

But the Sharm el-Sheikh talks could create a second-tier market for carbon credits. Called “mitigation contributions”, these would be used by private companies towards their climate goals, without any accounting tweak.

In that case, both the host country where the carbon-cutting project is located and the company paying for it could claim the same emission reduction.

What a company can claim when it buys an carbon credit is a key question for the credibility of the market.

Allowing a company to claim an offset already being used by a country is “corporate greenwashing,” Argentinian campaigner Catalina Gonda, of the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (Farn), told Climate Home.


It’s true that there is a real risk that credits can be, and indeed have been, used to avoid meaningful internal emissions reductions.

擔任工作坊導師之一的台北大學商學院企業永續發展研究中心諮詢顧問陳耀德，在進行國際企業環境趨勢分享時提及，企業要承諾淨零其實是有「國際規範」的，而且規範愈來愈嚴謹和講究，目的就是避免企業有錯誤認知或拿來當成「漂綠」口號。



-   Firstly, [carbon offsets](https://carboncredits.com/how-to-make-money-producing-and-selling-carbon-offsets/) are a **legitimate and effective way for individuals and companies to reduce their carbon footprint** and mitigate their contribution to climate change.
-   Secondly, carbon offset programs are **regulated by third-party organizations** that verify the validity and effectiveness of the offsets purchased. 
-   Lastly, carbon offset projects often **provide additional benefits beyond reducing carbon emissions**, such as supporting renewable energy development and improving local economies.

### 市場成長強勁

The Canadian Bank of Montreal or BMO recently released its report on the [voluntary carbon market](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-the-voluntary-carbon-market/) (VCM), providing an in-depth overview of market growth potential and complexity.

As per BMO’s projections, the banking giant sees the potential g[rowth of the VCM](https://carboncredits.com/what-drives-the-growth-of-the-carbon-offset-market-3-key-factors/) to reach **6.5x by 2030 and 17.4x by 2050**, relative to 2020 VCM total traded volumes.

-   That also means the VCM can hit an annual volume of **~1.2 GT CO2e by 2030 and 3.3 GT CO2e by 2050.**

According to Katusa Research, the number of companies that publicly declared net zero targets reached **3,152** in November 2022.

Tesla beat 1st quarter income expectations with more than double previous quarters’ carbon credit sales.

Tesla’s regulatory carbon credit sales account for over 20% of its profits this quarter. Tesla has warned that carbon credit sales in the future will fluctuate and decline.

### 驗證規範強化中

In fact, producing and selling carbon offsets is becoming a lucrative business in the U.S., and first movers have a big advantage. [Small farmers](https://carboncredits.com/farms-carbon-offset-projects/), ranchers, and landowners can earn extra income by optimizing their operations to produce carbon offsets.

A farmer can’t just create thousands of carbon offsets from his or her land by planting trees. There is a stringent [carbon verification process](https://carboncredits.com/who-verifies-carbon-credits/) and typically performed by one of the larger global services – like **Verra** and **Gold Standard**.

the [Carbon Offset Integrity Standard (COIS](https://icvcm.org/)) is an international standard that ensures carbon offset projects are real, permanent, and additional.

 As expected, high quality credits usually come at a higher cost. Companies that do their homework should be much more willing to pay a premium to guarantee impact and avoid being called out for [greenwashing](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/how-corporations-can-avoid-greenwashing).


### 3. 不只是減碳

In addition, carbon offset projects can also provide economic benefits to local communities by creating jobs and supporting economic development. For instance, a carbon offset project may involve planting trees in an area where employment is scarce, providing employment  opportunities and supporting the local economy.



### how to avoid greenwashing?

 What’s more, many climate terms do not have one universal definition: for example, an organization can claim to be [carbon neutral](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/what-is-carbon-neutral) because it may have [offset](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/what-is-a-carbon-offset) all its emissions (including scope 3) with high-quality [credits](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/what-is-a-carbon-credit), whereas another may also claim to be carbon neutral, but has offset only direct emissions for a specific product without performing any [due diligence](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/due-diligence-for-carbon-offsets) on [credit quality](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/how-to-rate-carbon-credits).

Greenwashing has become a widely used term to describe any misleading marketing or promotion about an organization’s positive impacts on the environment. This might be from misleading advertising, overstating claims, or misrepresenting the net impact of an organization’s impact on the environment.

Organizations that use offsetting alone to make climate claims, or are not transparent with their offsetting strategies, are particularly at risk. **However, carbon offsetting is not inherently greenwashing and has a critical role to play in the global net zero transition, as long as organizations consider 2 key points:**

1.  **Follow the mitigation hierarchy**

Offsetting is not an excuse to otherwise continue business as usual and avoid essential decarbonization activities. It should be used as part of a wider strategy that follows the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, reduce, offset), for example following the [VCMI Code of Practice](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice).

![](../005-Files/Pasted%20image%2020230118180753.png)

By following the mitigation hierarchy, organizations should aim to meet ambitious short and medium-term emissions reduction targets first before turning to carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint

_High-integrity carbon credits in voluntary markets should be used for beyond value chain mitigation but cannot be counted toward a non-state actor’s interim emissions reductions required by its net zero pathway._

Rather, companies should think about investing in carbon credits as making an additional contribution to global emissions reduction and climate change action.

2.  **Use high quality credits**

A high‐quality carbon credit should, at a minimum, fit the criteria of additionality (i.e. the mitigation activity would not have happened without the incentive created by the carbon credit revenues) and permanence.

Offsetting will only have a positive climate impact if the credits used are additional, permanent and justified by legitimate, verifiable carbon accounting. Credit buyers need to conduct sufficient due diligence to be sure of this, and should report transparently on this and the details of their use of credits.



3. transparency is key

Clearly reporting on environmental impacts in a way that is consistent between years and comparable between organizations allows stakeholders to accurately assess an organization’s claims. Failing to disclose this information risks suggesting that organizations have something to hide, or don’t have the facts to back up their claims.


案例

In 2019, Smartly.io started calculating their carbon footprint to find out both the sources and the amount of emissions. The initiative came from employees who were passionate about climate action.



### conclusion


![](../005-Files/Pasted%20image%2020230119140830.png)

As proponents of the mitigation hierarchy, we believe organizations should only buy offsets to compensate for emissions in the _short-term_ while they actively work to decarbonize. In the _long-term_, offsets should be viewed more like a carbon tax for unmitigated emissions as opposed to a get-out-of-jail-free card.

有五個氣候轉折點，是在人類達到1.5度升溫之後就無法返還的

The research, carried out by scientists at the University of Exeter in the UK, shows that at least five dangerous "tipping points" for the planet are rapidly approaching.

These include the collapse of the [**Greenland**](https://www.euronews.com/tag/greenland) and West Antarctic ice sheets, a sudden melting of the permafrost in northern regions, [**coral reefs**](https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/07/22/last-chance-to-save-coral-reefs-scientists-warn-of-climate-tipping-point) dying off and the collapse of an important ocean current in the North Atlantic.

> When change in that part of the system becomes self-sustaining, so it will keep on going even if warming was to actually start falling afterwards.

Dr Armstrong McKay

"We reassessed over 200 papers published since [2008], and we have come to the conclusion that at least five climate tipping points are already possible now, and four of those become likely beyond 1.5 degrees of warming," Dr Armstrong McKay adds.

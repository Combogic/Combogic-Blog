 Even though the Polish power system is based on fossil fuels, fleet electrification could contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions of 24%
 The decrease in operational costs by EUR 370 thousand/year is also significant.
 
The main conclusion is that even for a highly fossil fuel-dependant energy mix, indirect emissions for BEVs are lower than tailpipe emissions from ICE vehicles. The case study analysis shows that fleet electrification in the current fuel mix of the Polish power system (75% of electricity is still produced in coal-fired generation units, and 8% in natural gas-fired units) would decrease carbon emissions by 24%

Reducing emissions from businesses is crucial given that they are responsible for over [70% of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change). Carbon offset marketplaces link businesses and carbon offset projects, which can help achieve this goal. So, we had to ask: What are the best carbon offset marketplaces for businesses?

****The best carbon offset marketplaces for businesses in terms of overall impact are Puro.earth, Pledge, and Klimate.co. One Tribe specializes in nature-based offsets, Carbonx, Supercritical, and Salesforce are new marketplace additions, and South Pole and Terrapass offer traditional offset projects.****

Keep reading to learn more about the best carbon offset marketplaces for businesses, how these carbon offset projects work, what their respective offsetting costs are, and what your best way would be to offset your carbon emissions. At the end of the article, we’ll also share with you what the biggest carbon offsetting limitations are and why reducing your carbon footprint is more effective than offsetting it.

## Here’s What All the Best Carbon Offset Marketplaces for Businesses Have in Common

[**Carbon offsets**](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-03/documents/gpp_guide_recs_offsets.pdf) **are** [**reductions in carbon emissions**](https://www.britannica.com/technology/carbon-offset) **that are used to compensate for carbon emissions occurring elsewhere**. They are [measured](https://davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/carbon-offsets/) in tons of CO2 equivalents and are bought and sold through international brokers, online retailers, and trading platforms on what is known as the global carbon offset market. 

> _“_**_Carbon Offset_**_: a way for a company or person to reduce the level of carbon dioxide for which they are responsible by paying money to a company that works to reduce the total amount produced in the world, for example by planting trees”_
> 
> _Oxford Dictionary_

When you purchase carbon offsets, it’s important that they actually make a difference in total carbon emissions. To achieve that, the following are key criteria:

-   Carbon offset projects have to be effective (different projects have different effectiveness rates)
-   Carbon offset projects have to be additional
-   Carbon offset projects have to be permanent
-   The claims from carbon offset projects have to be verifiable

![Screenshot of the puro.earth front page](https://impactful.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/puro.earth-front-page-1024x527.png)

[**Puro.earth**](https://puro.earth/) was founded in 2019 on the realization that we have too much CO2 in our atmosphere and no business model for carbon removal with carbon net-negative technologies. They focus only on measurable carbon removal and require methods that capture and store CO2 for at least 50 years. Their [mission](https://puro.earth/about-us/) is to mobilize the world’s economy to reward carbon net-negative emissions and reverse climate change.

> _“Choosing a carbon removal partner is a matter of trust”_
> 
> _Puro Earth_

**Carbon offset overview**: Puro.earth’s business model revolves around the [**CO****2** **removal certificate**](https://puro.earth/carbon-market/) **(CORC)**. Every CORC represents one metric ton of CO2 removed from the atmosphere by a [Puro Standard methodology](https://puro.earth/carbon-removal-methods/), which includes: biochar, bio-based construction materials, carbonated building elements, geologically stored carbon, and woody biomass burial. 

[The Puro.earth marketplace works as follows](https://puro.earth/):

1.  First, Puro.earth identifies suppliers with net-negative emissions. 
2.  After rigorous verification, the net negative emissions are turned into [carbon removal credits](https://puro.earth/buy-carbon-credits/) (CORCs). 
3.  Companies buy CORCs to offset carbon emissions they can not avoid or reduce. 
4.  Buyers retire the CORCs to support net zero emissions claims and/or to develop carbon neutral products or services. 

[Puro.earth’s CORC marketplace](https://puro.earth/CORC-co2-removal-certificate/) currently has 32 carbon removal suppliers, 9 of which are available for online purchase. Current [methodologies supported](https://puro.earth/faq/) are biochar, carbonated building elements, and bio-based construction materials.

**Carbon offset effectiveness**: Every CORC is listed in the [Puro Registry](https://registry.puro.earth/carbon-sequestration/retirements) and is only issued after the carbon removal has occurred. Puro.earth also has third-party independent verifiers who audit carbon removal project facilities and issue CORCs. Lastly, rigorous verification processes are used to ensure all products and processes are truly carbon-net negative. 

**Carbon offset costs**: CORCs can range anywhere from [$20 per CORC to $535 per CORC](https://puro.earth/CORC-co2-removal-certificate/?sort_field=item_price%7Cdesc&map=1#), depending on the project methodology.

**How to get your carbon offsets**: Visit the Puro.earth [CORC marketplace](https://puro.earth/CORC-co2-removal-certificate/?sort_field=item_price%7Cdesc&map=1#) website to view and purchase your CORCs. Or, you can buy future CORCs from projects in development through [advanced market commitment](https://puro.earth/accelerate/)s and Pre-CORCs.

## How to Choose Carbon Offset Projects Actually Make a Difference

The following information is a summary for you based on our full guide: “[How to Buy Carbon Offsets That Actually Make a Difference](https://impactful.ninja/buy-carbon-offsets-that-make-a-difference/)”

Purchase carbon offset projects with high effectiveness rates. The offset programs in order of most to least effective are:

-   **Direct CO****2** **removal**: Machines remove CO2 directly from the air. Effective at reducing emissions in the short and long-term because they are additional and permanent.
-   **Renewable energy**: Investing in projects that build and maintain renewable energy sites globally. There is no additionality because renewables are becoming a greater share of our energy mix, with or without the help of offsets.
-   **Energy efficiency improvements**: The creation of products or systems that use less energy than conventional systems to perform the same task. However, if products are replaced too quickly, the amount of CO2 required to produce the new product would exceed the amount of CO2 saved with the new product.
-   **Carbon sequestration**: The long-term storage of carbon via forestry practices. Not an effective way to reduce emissions in the long-term because there is no guaranteed permanence.

If – and only if – they are both additional and permanent, **carbon offsets can help reduce your overall GHG emissions to balance off your personal carbon footprint to fight climate change – at least in the short term**. But they can be much more effective if they meet certain key criteria and project standards.

Here are [**key criteria**](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/peter-miller/carbon-offsets-101) to look for in a carbon offset program:

-   **A clearly defined** [**protocol**](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/peter-miller/carbon-offsets-101) that determines which types of projects are eligible and how emission reductions will be measured

-   **Independent third-party** [**verification**](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/peter-miller/carbon-offsets-101) of compliance with the protocol

-   **Registration of offsets in an** [**offset registry**](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/peter-miller/carbon-offsets-101)**,** which tracks each credit with a unique serial number to ensure it is only used once 

-   [**Transparency**](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/peter-miller/carbon-offsets-101) in project implementation and reporting 

If used correctly, carbon offsets can provide environmental, economic, and social benefits that go beyond reducing carbon emissions. They have the potential to instigate meaningful environmental change and begin to reverse some of the effects of climate change. 

[**Carbon offset project standards**](https://www.terrapass.com/standards/) assure transparency and quality in the creation, quantification, and verification of offset projects. This way you can ensure that the project is actually reducing CO2 emissions. The following are recognized carbon offset standards:

-   [**Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)**](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/): Considered the world’s leading voluntary GHG program, with 1700+ projects having removed 630+ million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. Examples of projects include hydropower in [Turkey](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2097), forest conservation in [Peru](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2278), and landfill gas capture in [China](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2337).

-   [**Gold Standard**](https://www.goldstandard.org/about-us/our-impact): A certification that seeks to maximize every dollar of climate and development funding. It has issued [134 million carbon credits](https://www.goldstandard.org/about-us/our-impact) from [1700+ projects](https://www.goldstandard.org/about-us/our-impact) based in more than [80 different countries](https://www.goldstandard.org/about-us/our-impact). Examples of projects include solar power in India, efficient cooking and heating in China, and wind power in Indonesia.

-   [**Climate Action Reserve (CAR)**](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/about-us/): The premier carbon offset [registry](https://thereserve2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp?r=111) for the North American carbon market having issued over [150 million offset credits](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/about-us/) since its inception in 2001. Examples of projects include landfill gas capture in [South Carolina](https://thereserve2.apx.com/mymodule/reg/prjView.asp?id1=574) and forest management in [California](https://thereserve2.apx.com/mymodule/reg/prjView.asp?id1=1013).

-   [**American Carbon Registry (ACR)**](https://americancarbonregistry.org/): The first private voluntary GHG registry in the world. Examples of [projects](https://acr2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp?r=111) include ozone-depleting substances in [Arkansas](https://acr2.apx.com/mymodule/reg/prjView.asp?id1=206) and methane capture from mines in [Kentucky](https://acr2.apx.com/mymodule/reg/prjView.asp?id1=342).

Choosing carbon offset projects from any of the above project standard registries helps ensure that your project is verified and that it actually reduces CO2 emissions.

## What Are the Biggest Carbon Offsetting Limitations

In fact, there are 9 main carbon offsetting limitations that can make the current voluntary carbon market controversial and lead to confusion, inconsistencies, and a general distrust of the system. Have a look at the quick summary table below.

**Carbon Offsetting Limitation**

**Quick Facts**

#1: You don’t reduce your own carbon footprint

When you purchase a carbon offset, you are paying someone else to cut their emissions so you don’t have to cut your own emissions.

#2: Carbon offsets do not work at the core issue of reducing CO2 emissions

Global warming is still occurring at an accelerated rate because offsetting CO2 emissions does not cut CO2 emissions at the source, it only mitigates emissions.

#3: Carbon offsetting only reduces CO2 if the projects are additional and permanent

If carbon offset projects are not additional and permanent, they can make climate change worse because they are not offsetting any carbon.

#4: “Poorer” countries are paid to offset carbon while the “rich” countries continue to emit

The richest of the world emit the majority of the world’s carbon. Offsets are just licenses to pollute with the benefit of aiding those in developing countries.

#5: Different projects have different effectiveness rates

The varying levels of effectiveness of carbon offset programs make it difficult to choose one that actually reduces emissions. The most effective offset programs are renewable energy programs, followed by energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and aviation offset programs. 

#6: CO2 offsets are only realized at the end of project durations 

If a carbon offset program is not carried out until the end, then we cannot reap the program’s benefits. For example, planting trees is a common offset program that is only effective if those planted trees are protected during their life span for the carbon benefits to be realized. 

#7: There are not enough offsets for all CO2 emissions

We emit far more CO2 than we can offset because of carbon sink (e.g., atmosphere, forests, soil, ocean) limitations.

#8: Not all offset projects get realized

Of the credits for 1 billion tons of CO2 listed on registries, only about 300-400 million tons of CO2 offsets actually get realized. 

#9: Carbon offsetting projects are often used as greenwashing

Investing in non-verified credits, not prioritizing in-house emissions reductions, and double-counting carbon credits are methods of greenwashing. Also, companies may advertise a specific program, but it may be just for public attention instead of actually reducing emissions.

**Related**: You can check out the full article here: “[What Are the Biggest Carbon Offsetting Limitations? (All 9 Explained)](https://impactful.ninja/biggest-carbon-offsetting-limitations/)”

## Why Reducing Your Carbon Footprint Is More Effective Than Offsetting It

The main argument against carbon offsets is that [they don’t really reduce overall emissions](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/the-biggest-problem-with-carbon-offsetting-is-that-it-doesnt-really-work/). **Instead of substituting offsetting carbon emissions, we should instead cut the emissions directly at the source.** Basically, if we stop emissions from getting into the atmosphere in the first place, we won’t have to worry about offsetting. But have we done this? Have we cut emissions directly at the source? The data says no. 

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the largest decrease in energy-related carbon emissions since World War II, a decrease of [2 billion tons](https://www.iea.org/news/after-steep-drop-in-early-2020-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-have-rebounded-strongly). However, emissions rebounded quickly at the end of 2020, with levels in December ending [60 million tons](https://www.iea.org/news/after-steep-drop-in-early-2020-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-have-rebounded-strongly) higher than those in December 2019. This indicates that **the earth is still warming at an accelerated rate**, and not enough is being done to implement clean energy practices. 

![Illustration of annual CO2 emissions globally](https://impactful.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/annual-co2-emissions-by-region-1024x723.png)

[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions): Annual total CO2 emissions

**When you buy a carbon offset, you are paying someone else to cut their emissions so you don’t have to cut your own emissions**. This is why offsetting alone will not be enough to reduce global carbon emissions.

Carbon offsets are a good place to start if you want to get into the carbon-emission reduction game, but in order to be effective in the long term, we must not rely on them solely. Cutting emissions from the source and then offsetting the remainder is the best way to reduce our carbon footprint and provide the highest environmental benefits. If we fail to cut emissions first, we will fill up our carbon sinks and render them unusable. **Preventing carbon emissions rather than reacting once they are already emitted is the best way to reduce overall emissions.**

Carbon offsets reduce GHG emissions from [coal](https://impactful.ninja/the-carbon-footprint-of-coal-energy/), [oil](https://impactful.ninja/the-carbon-footprint-of-oil-energy/), and [natural gas](https://impactful.ninja/the-carbon-footprint-of-natural-gas/). Reducing your consumption of these, in turn, reduces your carbon footprint, which has huge impacts on environmental, economic, and public health. A reduced carbon footprint due to lower GHG emissions can [mitigate the effects of climate change, improve public health, boost the economy, and maintain plant and animal diversity](https://impactful.ninja/why-reducing-your-carbon-footprint-is-important/).

-   **Climate change**: [Reducing your carbon footprint](https://impactful.ninja/why-reducing-your-carbon-footprint-is-important/) plays a role in mitigating the side effects of global climate change. The more we reduce the amount of GHG emissions, the more we slow the rate of [temperature rise, sea-level rise, ice melting, and ocean acidification](https://www.nwf.org/educational-resources/wildlife-guide/threats-to-wildlife/climate-change)**.**

-   [**Public health**](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/climatechange/health_impacts/index.cfm): Reducing GHG emissions lessens the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events, improves air and water quality, maintains biodiversity, and supports a healthy food supply.

-   **Economics**: Reducing GHG boosts the economy, especially when it becomes [economically rewarding](https://www.carbontax.org/whats-a-carbon-tax/) to innovate solutions that help protect our planet, fight climate change, and are based on clean energy.

-   **Pla****nt and animal diversity:** Protecting biodiversity protects human health because many plants and animals are used in [modern medicines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/biodiversity-and-health)

Carbon offsets have the potential to instigate meaningful environmental change, but to make the greatest impact we must understand both their benefits AND drawbacks.

## Final Thoughts

Puro.earth, Pledge, Klimate.co, One Tribe, South Pole, Patch, Nori, Pachama, Carbonfuture, Terrapass, Salesforce, Carbonx, and Supercritical have the best carbon offset marketplaces for businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint. They are third-party verified, permanent, additional, use the leading carbon offset standards, and adhere to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

But for all of the good carbon offsets can instigate, they should not be seen as the only solution to climate change. They are effective at reducing CO2 in the short-term, but in the long term they fail to reduce CO2 enough. When used in conjunction with direct CO2 reduction measures, carbon offsetting can be much more effective. We should reduce our own carbon footprint as much as possible first before relying on offsets.

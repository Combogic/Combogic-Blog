Right now, the VCM is opaque with most credits trading over-the-counter. As such, price discovery and transparency are a challenge.

Evidently, direct, bilateral transactions for offsets remained the top choice for buyers and sellers.

As [carbon exchanges](https://carboncredits.com/the-top-4-carbon-exchanges-for-2022/) provide the most transparent pricing data, transaction preference impacts market transparency.

Prices from exchanges don’t represent the market as a whole. But their movements may offer context on price momentum in the VCM.

With all these, investors must consider pricing transparency alongside the quality of carbon credits.

Overall, there are only a few official offsetting guidelines. These include the [VCMI](https://carboncredits.com/vcmi-code-for-ranking-companies-using-carbon-credits/), SBTi, and the Oxford Principles.

While that’s the case, BMO thinks that there’s a growing agreement on ways of best practice that will affect offsets demand and shape the voluntary carbon market.

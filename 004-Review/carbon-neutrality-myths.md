# 7 myths about carbon neutrality

Carbon neutrality is a term that has gained popularity in recent years, especially after the Paris Agreement on climate change and the growing awareness of the impacts of global warming. But what does it really mean, and how can it be achieved? In this blog post, we will debunk some of the common myths about carbon neutrality and explain why it is a crucial goal for humanity.

## Myth 1: Carbon neutrality means zero emissions
Carbon neutrality does not mean that no greenhouse gases are emitted at all. Rather, it means that any emissions are balanced by removing an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either through natural processes (such as forests or oceans) or through technological solutions (such as carbon capture and storage). This way, the net effect of human activities on the climate is neutralized.

## Myth 2: Carbon neutrality is too expensive
Some people argue that pursuing carbon neutrality would hurt the economy and require huge investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-carbon technologies. However, this argument ignores the benefits of carbon neutrality, such as improved public health, reduced air pollution, enhanced energy security, and new green jobs. Moreover, it overlooks the costs of inaction, such as the damages from extreme weather events, sea level rise, biodiversity loss, and social unrest. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency, achieving net zero emissions by 2050 would require only about 1% of global GDP per year, while generating $3 trillion in annual economic benefits by 2030.

## Myth 3: Carbon neutrality is not feasible
Some people doubt that carbon neutrality is technically or politically feasible, given the current dependence on fossil fuels and the lack of global cooperation. However, this pessimism is unwarranted, as there are many examples of countries, cities, companies, and organizations that have committed to or achieved carbon neutrality. For instance, Bhutan is already a carbon-negative country, meaning that it absorbs more carbon than it emits. The European Union has pledged to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. More than 1000 companies have joined the Science Based Targets initiative to align their emissions reduction plans with the Paris Agreement goals.

## Myth 4: Carbon neutrality is enough
Some people think that achieving carbon neutrality is sufficient to prevent dangerous climate change and ensure a safe future for humanity. However, this is not true, as carbon neutrality only stabilizes the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but does not reduce it. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we need to go beyond carbon neutrality and reach carbon negativity, meaning that we remove more carbon than we emit. This would require enhancing natural sinks and deploying negative emission technologies at a large scale.

## Myth 5: Carbon neutrality is a distant goal
Some people think that carbon neutrality is a goal for the distant future and that we have plenty of time to achieve it. However, this is not true, as every year of delay increases the risk of irreversible and catastrophic climate impacts. According to the IPCC, to have a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we need to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and halve them by 2030. This means that we need to act urgently and decisively in this decade to transform our energy systems, transport systems, industrial systems, agricultural systems, and consumption patterns.

## Myth 6: Carbon neutrality is a burden
Some people think that pursuing carbon neutrality would require sacrificing our quality of life and giving up our comforts and conveniences. However, this is not true, as carbon neutrality can be achieved in ways that enhance our well-being and happiness. For example, switching to renewable energy sources can reduce air pollution and noise pollution, improving our health and mood. Improving energy efficiency can lower our energy bills and save us money. Adopting low-carbon lifestyles can foster community spirit and social cohesion.

## Myth 7: Carbon neutrality is a responsibility
Some people think that achieving carbon neutrality is a responsibility that we owe to future generations and to other species that share our planet. However, this is not true, as carbon neutrality is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity and a privilege. It is an opportunity to create a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and prosperous society for ourselves and for others. It is a privilege to be part of a historic transition that will shape the future of humanity and life on Earth.
